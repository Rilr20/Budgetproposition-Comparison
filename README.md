# Budgetproposition Comparison

## Description

This project aims to compare the budget propositions of each year to identify the percentage increase and decrease in expenditure areas. It also has the potential to include income areas and display them, though this feature is not implemented.

## Current Status

This project was just made for fun where I applied technologies I'm familiar with and learn more about. 

## Requirements

- Python for data extraction
- TypeScript and Svelte for data display

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TypeScript
- Svelte

## Data Sources

### Budgetproposition
Budgetpropositionen from [Regeringen](https://regeringen.se/) that has been tested on.
* 2021 https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2020/09/prop.-2020211
* 2022 https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2021/09/prop.-2021221
* 2023 https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2022/11/prop.-2022231
* 2024 https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2023/09/prop.-2023241

### Konsumentproduktindex
Inflation data from [SCB](https://www.scb.se)
- [Konsumentprisindex (KPI)](https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/priser-och-konsumtion/konsumentprisindex/konsumentprisindex-kpi/pong/tabell-och-diagram/konsumentprisindex-kpi/kpi-faststallda-tal-1980100/) 

## Known Issues

- Potential regex edge cases that may appear in untested budget propositions.

- Challenges in handling changes in naming conventions for the different budget propositions, one example being when comparing 2021 and 2022 (to 2024) "2 Riksdagen och dess myndigheter" and "2 Riksdagen samt Riksdagens ombudsm√§n", should logically be considered the same but are treated as separate entities due to the change in naming.

- Expense areas with identical names may match with the wrong one.

## Future Enhancements

- The possibility to include income areas and display them, as the data is available but not currently used or extracted.

- Pagination on table so it doesn't load all the data
